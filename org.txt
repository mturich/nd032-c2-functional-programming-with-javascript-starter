So I describe a memory place where you visited recently. I want to talk about the Europe Park, thats an adventure parks in southern Germany, next to France and Switzerland. The adventure park consists of multiple roller coasters. There are a lot of other smaller roller coasters or things to do for smaller kids. And we went there with my family, that's me, my wife and our four kids and two weeks ago.


So normally how this evolves is that we wake up early in the morning, prepare everything so that we can be there at 09:00, which also includes a journey of an hour for us. So we need to hit the road at 08:00 to be there at nine o and then we have a whole day of a lot of fun.


Scene park has a lot of different sections where each section is called country and there are different styles. And there's one style like Switzerland. Then there is one part which is more like Russia, for example. Then there is one part more like Spain. All the roller coasters are also built in that very design in a more Italian way, in a more Hispanic way, in a more Switzerlandish way.


And for the kids it's amazing because they have a lot of impressions and it's like a dream come true for kids. It's their own small world.
